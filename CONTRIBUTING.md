## Commits

- When commiting, try to make commits "atomic". That is, each task or fix in whatever you are doing should
become one commit to the repository. This is not only useful for reviewers, but allows you to rollback specific
parts of your code without loosing everything else.
- An in-depth guide to atomic commits may be found [here](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/).

## Coding Standards

- All code written should be covered by automated tests. No exceptions. There is no definitive guide
as to what kind of test you should write, but common sense applies. If you need any clarification, 
please contact the Web Services Team.
